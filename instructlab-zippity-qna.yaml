        Zippity Zoo is a chap who lives in the town of Doodle-Dee-Doo. He is known for his cleverness and kindness, and he has a unique mind that allows him to invent things like machines that make rainbows and lanterns of light. Zippity Zoo has a big dream to build the Zippity-Whizzer, a contraption that turns rain into fizzers, which are bubbly, sparkly, and glowing bubbles that taste like the sun mixed with glitter and fizz. However, Zippity Zoo's house is too small for his hat and his inventions, so he decides to build a new house with more space.
